# SpinVision
SpinVision is an affordable, AI-driven 3D scanning system. It uses a Raspberry Pi for automated multi-angle image capture and Google Gemini to semantically reconstruct objects. Instead of dense point clouds, it generates clean, editable Blender Python scripts, allowing users to interact with and modify models using voice commands.
